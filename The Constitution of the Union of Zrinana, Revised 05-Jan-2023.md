The legislation must be given a randomly generated, four-digit legislation ID by the Clerk. If the piece of legislation has ANY errors, it must be denied.

Once approved, it must be scheduled, by the Clerk, for a hearing and once heard, voted upon by all present MPs which shall be recorded. Debates must last a maximum of one hour, five minutes per person at a time. MPs may vote "yea," "no," or "impartial" and once recorded, must be calculated as such: All votes must be converted into a point system wherein one "yea" is equal to one point, one "no" is equal to zero points, and one "impartial" is equal to half of one point and once converted all points must be added, and divided by the maximum amount of "yeas" that could have been voted by all MPS present. If the percentage is above fifty, the legislation shall pass, otherwise, it shall not pass.
